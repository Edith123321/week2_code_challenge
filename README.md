# Shopping List SPA

A **Single Page Application (SPA)** for managing a shopping list. This app allows users to dynamically add items, mark them as "bought," and delete items with intuitive interactions.

- **Mark Items as Bought**:
  Click on an item to toggle its "bought" status. Bought items are decorated with a strikethrough (`line-through`).

- **Delete Items**:
  Remove items from the list by clicking on the trash can icon.

- **User-Friendly**:
  A responsive app with an intuitive interface.
